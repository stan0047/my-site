The portfolio website features a captivating Pacman loader that adds a touch of playfulness and nostalgia. Inspired by the classic arcade game, the Pacman loader animates as users navigate through the site, creating an engaging and delightful user experience. The animated Pacman moves across the screen, mimicking its original behavior, while the dots behind it represent the loading progress. This attention-grabbing loader not only adds visual interest but also symbolizes the continuous exploration and progress showcased within the projects listed on the portfolio. It serves as a reminder of the timeless appeal of retro gaming and brings a touch of fun to the browsing experience.
